# Using JavaScript to create a map with markers and layers

This is a follow-up to Assignment 7 (Map Making part). I enjoyed this assignment because I like maps, and I would love to have experimented with different layer types in this assignment. So, I modified this to accommodate a satellite layer and a layer toggle button. Not the most groundbreaking changes, but still a fun (and hopefully useful!) one.
