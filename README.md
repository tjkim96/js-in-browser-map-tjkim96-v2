# Using JavaScript to create a map with markers 

Create a map with at least 3 markers. The markers should have a label that displays as a popup window. Choose an appropriate zoom level and 'center' of your map.  You should use JavaScript to place the markers on the map (don't create the map manually and then embed it onto the page).  You can choose your own data, or use the data from three National Parks in Massachusetts that are provided in `scripts/parksData.js`.

I recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) paired with Open Street Map tiles.  You can see an example at: [Harvard Yard map](https://cscie12.dce.harvard.edu/maps/).  But you are free to use whatever map library you wish!

I also recommend using a CDN to load your map library JS and CSS files.
